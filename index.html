<h1 style="font-family:arial;">Situating COVID-19</h1>
<p style="font-family:arial;"In the wake of COVID-19, there has been a fair bit of data thrown about. In the space of a few weeks, we have been asked to become amateur statisticians, trying to grasp daily death rates, numbers of cases, curves, and what the infamous R actually means. Some of us have been more successful than others, and social media is now awash with armchair epidemiologists, with more or less accuracy depending on their agenda.</p>
<p style="font-family:arial;"Yet, it seems that the to-ing and fro-ing of data politics, combined with the sheer volume of COVID-19 data being produced around the world, has rendered the experience of the pandemic into an overwhelming, and more and more abstracted, experience of the pandemic. The messy spaces of the pandemic have meant that both the sources of this data - and the way in which it is calculated - has been hotly debated. For instance, lower testing numbers mean lower case numbers, and so is it better to extrapolate or generalise from a testing survey of a small number of the population; if fewer people are dying in hospitals, should we only count hospital-registered COVID-19 deaths, or should we be looking at the excess number of deaths compared to the same period last year? </p>
<p style="font-family:arial;"These debates over health data have also become increasingly politicised as world leaders draw criticism or praise for their response to the pandemic in its early stages. Leaders are shuffling and playing with numbers in an attempt to downplay political consequences, and to make national responses appear better in comparison to the responses of other countries. Graphs and visualisations besiege us with international comparisons of curves, and the latest figures.</p>
<p style="font-family:arial;"On the other hand, personal stories have emerged of loss and grief, brutal in their helplessness and the spaces left behind. The closeness of photographs and mournful obituaries overwhelm us in another fashion by hitting so hard, and often so close, that it is sometimes difficult to breathe.</p>
<p style="font-family:arial;"The country in which I live is slowly opening up after its first wave. I have spent the last few months in lockdown, staring out the window at an empty world, glancing at lone shoppers as we tiptoe around one another. Near a major hospital, my partner and I would often be woken by the sound of ambulances. As they tore past in the middle of the night,  I wonder silently if the life being carried was fighting COVID-19, or something else. Nurses and healthcare workers walked back to their cars parked on our street, as I tried to imagine what their eyes saw that mine did not, what the scale of our loss is, because it is not wholly felt by me, inside. </p>
<p style="font-family:arial;"Now everything and everyone is starting to move again, the sound of cars and traffic is slowly joining the sound of ambulances and helicopters. I often find myself watching the growing parade of people on the streets and wonder who has been lost. No-one I know has died, although plenty have been ill (myself included). How badly have we been impacted, how many of those around me have we lost?</p>
<p style="font-family:arial;"And so, I find myself searching for a space of understanding between the abstract mathematics of the enormous data sets that are released every day by governments and media, and the heartbreaking stories that are beginning to emerge across social media. What is 100,000 or 60,000 or indeed 100 people in relation to our own worlds, the spaces we inhabit, the communities we build and the other peopleâ€™s lives with which we intersect? </p>
<p style="font-family:arial;"The graphs and maps presented below are a simple attempt to try to resituate the COVID-19 data from the 28th May 2020 in a way that resonates with everyday lived worlds. The data is not perfect. There are gaps and stutters: this is the nature of data generally, let alone the data generated by a complicated world in flux. I have not tried to be fancy, either. Please take these visualisations as impressions rather than truths - as if any data visualisation could be anything else. They are stories, if nothing else. </p>
