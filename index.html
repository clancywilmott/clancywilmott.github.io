<h1 style="font-family:arial;">Situating COVID-19</h1>
<p style="font-family:arial;">In the wake of COVID-19, a fair bit of data has been thrown about. We have been asked to become amateur statisticians in the space of a few weeks, as we try to grasp the meaning of daily death rates, numbers of cases, curves, and the infamous R. Sometimes it feels like the sweeping volume of COVID-19 data produced around the world has rendered the experience of the pandemic into an overwhelming experience that is more and more abstracted from our everyday lives. </p>
<p style="font-family:arial;">The messy spaces of the pandemic means that both data sources and data veracity - and the way in which data is calculated - have been hotly contested: reported deaths vs excess deaths; suspected cases vs tested cases. These debates over health data have also become increasingly politicised as world leaders draw criticism or praise for their response to COVID-19. Politicians shuffle numbers to downplay socio-economic consequences and to make their own national responses appear more effective compared to other countries.</p>
<p style="font-family:arial;">Against the swell of data, personal stories of loss and grief have also emerged. They are brutal in their pain, helplessness and senselessness. The closeness of these stories overwhelm us differently by hitting so hard, and often so close, that it is sometimes difficult to breathe.</p>
<p style="font-family:arial;">The country where I live is slowly opening up after its first wave. I have spent the last few months in lockdown, staring out the window at an empty world and tiptoeing around people at the shops. Living near a major hospital, my partner and I would often be woken by the sound of ambulances as they tore past in the middle of the night. For months, I have wondered silently if the life being carried was fighting COVID-19. Around my neighbourhood, nurses and healthcare workers walk back to their parked cars, and I try to imagine what their eyes have seen that mine have not. What is the scale of our loss, because for many of us it has slipped by our closed doors </p>
<p style="font-family:arial;">Now everything and everyone is starting to move again. The sound of traffic and voices is again slowly joining the sound of the ambulances. I find myself watching people as they walk by, and wondering who is missing. How badly have we been impacted, how many of those around me have we lost? No-one I know has died, although plenty, like me, have been ill. </p>
<p style="font-family:arial;">And so as we brace for more waves, I find myself searching for a space of understanding between the abstract mathematics of big data and the deep grief of every life gone. What is 100,000 or 60,000 or indeed 100 people in relation to our own worlds, the spaces we inhabit, the communities we build and the other peopleâ€™s lives with which we intersect? </p>
<p style="font-family:arial;">The graphs and maps presented below are a simple attempt to try to resituate the COVID-19 data from the 28th May 2020 in a way that resonates with everyday lived worlds. The data is not perfect. There are gaps and stutters: this is the nature of data generally, let alone the data generated by a complicated world in flux. I have not tried to be fancy, either. Please take these visualisations as impressions rather than truths - as if any data visualisation could be anything else. They are stories in their own way, if nothing else. </p>
